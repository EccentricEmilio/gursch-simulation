COMPLETE GameEngine
- Add first phase
- Add mini gursch, in some 
- Add handling for sevens




1. Pure GameEngine (done / almost)
2. Legal move generator
3. Rule-based AI
4. Large-scale simulation
5. Data collection
6. Simple RL (tabular)
7. (Later) function approximation / neural nets


Implement engine.legal_moves(state, player)

Write 2–3 rule-based policies

Run 10k–100k simulations and log stats


Policy rules:

Takes (state, player, legal_moves)
Returns one move
Stateless (except ML memory)

Required policies:

RandomPolicy
LowestLegalPolicy
GreedyPolicy
HumanPolicy

Engine responsibilities

Generate legal moves
Apply moves
Advance game state

AI training path

Rule-based policies
Self-play simulations
Data collection
Tabular RL
(Later) Neural nets
